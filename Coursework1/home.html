<h2>What is the simpsons movie</h2>
<p class="synopsis">The Simpsons movie follows many people's favourite animated characters Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and many other fan favourites.
  It follows Homer, who has been taking care of the famous ‘Spider Pig’, after he drops a massive silo of waste into Springfield’s lake so he could eat some donuts. This leads to him
  causing a massive pollution on a grand scale causing Springfield to be encased by an impenetrable dome sent by the EPA (United states Environmental Protection Agency). Which brings upon
  an exciting adventure with these characters that follow them across Springfield and even to Alaska. This exciting and action-packed movie with fantastic funny moments builds to an
  even greater movie for all ages to watch.
